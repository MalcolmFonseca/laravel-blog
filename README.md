Personal blog and portfolio made using Laravel for the first time. Following along with the Laracast series: <a href="https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-8-from-scratch">Laravel 8 From Scratch</a>

Styling is heavily inspired by typical indie web designs, hopefully with equal amounts charm and usability.

Currently not deployed as originally I wanted to deploy to Vercel, however now I am wanting to self-host the domain from my home server. I am currently working on the configuration and network setup to ensure there are no security holes.

Other large things to add:
    - admin pages to manage projects
    - admin page to manage categories
    - functioning contact page with mailing
